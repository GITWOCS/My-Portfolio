        Very young, I acknowledged the privilege I had to get accustomed to technology through the use of my sister’s computer - a device most people could not access by then. To that effect, I established my first leadership position by organizing a training session in my house, where I could share with my peers the knowledge I had of the computer. Taking the small steps into the big ones, I continuously built my network and leadership, which led me to co-found my secondary school’s Computer Science Club.<br>
        From childhood, I have acknowledged a lack of technological opportunities in my locality. These have triggered me to get involved and nourished my passion for technology, thereby compelling me to become a computer engineer. To achieve this, I work extra-hard to maintain a high GPA while continuously engaging in tech challenges. Following my exploration of technology's seemingly limitless possibilities, I decided to pursue a software engineering career to fulfill my desire to solve problems in my community. Besides, as a kyphosis patient, I hope to use my acquired technological skills to create healthcare tech-based solutions that will benefit other kyphosis patients.<br>
        Though impaired, I have never relinquished my efforts. I work incredibly hard to accomplish my objectives to empower my neighborhood and get teenagers involved in technology. I have always been interested in tech-related ventures, which has helped me develop a strong reputation. As a result, many people often approached me for assistance in various technological fields. To that end, with the help of a friend, I developed a concept known as GITWOCS, meaning Get Into The World Of Computer Science. As first step, I created a YouTube channel - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCp1msMhlODuc-hZ7LpE0Rmg" target="blank">link:</a>. I teach my peers and juniors how to program in C, HTML, and CSS via this channel, and I intend to expand to other fields as I gain more experience. I am constantly motivated to help because I frequently receive feedback from my peers expressing their satisfaction and success after taking my courses.<br>
        I have continuously worked and reflected on the possible ways to expand my idea. I recently launched an online training boot camp; where my friend and I we teach and entertain the participants in Web Development and Programming - C and Python. Through this training, we strive to instill in the youth population the desire to learn more about technology and its benefits. I strive to get as many people as possible to develop the love for tech as I do and I was working towards achieving greater things and covering greater milestones with this project!
